Daytime and evening hours are available by appointment.  

Payment
of $120 for individual 60 minute session or $150 for couples or family 
sessions via cash, check, or credit card is expected at the time of 
service. Reciept is given and subsequent appointment time is 
acknowledged at the end of each session.

Payment is in most cases insurance reimbursable -- most insurance policies are accepted.

In
the event that I am a preferred provider with your insurance group and 
authorization has been established, a co-payment is acceptable in lieu 
of the aforementioned rate.

In circumstances of financial difficulty sliding scale is applicable.

A
$60 administrative fee may be incurred if cancellation does not happen 
with forty-eight hour notice.  No call no show will incur a full session
cancellation fee.
