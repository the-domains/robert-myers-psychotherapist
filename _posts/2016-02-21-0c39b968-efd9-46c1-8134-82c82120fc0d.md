"As a psychotherapist I have assisted individuals, couples, and families to become healthier in their relationships, to address their addiction challenges, and to make meaning of traumatic personal suffering.  My work being [solution focused][0] while drawing from a [mythopoetic][1][depth][2] orientation pays special attention to how the challenges in the moment[][3]illuminate opportunities and goals for the future.  My overarching specialty is the enhancement of personal and spiritual fulfillment through creativity and choice."
