"As a psychotherapist I have assisted individuals, couples, and families to become healthier in their relationships, to address their addiction challenges, and to make meaning of traumatic personal suffering.  My work being solution focused while drawing from a mythopoetic depth orientation pays special attention to how the challenges in the moment illuminate
opportunities and goals for the future.  My overarching specialty is 
the enhancement of personal and spiritual fulfillment through creativity
and choice."
