# I am a psychotherapist trained in the [Depth][0]
tradition of Carl [Jung][1], James [Hillman][2], and Joseph [Campbell][3].

"As a psychotherapist I have assisted individuals, couples, and families to become healthier in their relationships, to address their addiction challenges, and to make meaning of traumatic personal suffering.  **My work being [solution focused][4] while drawing from a [mytho][5][poetic][6][depth][6] orientation pays special attention to how the challenges in the moment illuminate
opportunities and goals for the future.** My overarching specialty is 
the enhancement of personal and spiritual fulfillment through creativity
and choice."
