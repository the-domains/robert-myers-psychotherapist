# I am a psychotherapist trained in the Depth 
tradition of Carl Jung, James Hillman, and Joseph Campbell.

"As a psychotherapist I have assisted individuals, couples, and families to become healthier in their relationships, to address their addiction challenges, and to make meaning of traumatic personal suffering.  **My work being [solution focused][0] while drawing from a [mytho][1][poetic][2][depth][2] orientation pays special attention to how the challenges in the moment illuminate
opportunities and goals for the future.** My overarching specialty is 
the enhancement of personal and spiritual fulfillment through creativity
and choice."
