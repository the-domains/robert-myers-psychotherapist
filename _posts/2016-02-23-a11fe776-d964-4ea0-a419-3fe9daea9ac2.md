The
first session is dedicated to receiving the client and listening to why
therapy is being initiated.  This may be an initial treatment or a 
course of therapy dedicated to a deeper understanding of a prior 
explored or a newly emerging condition. 

A
careful history is taken allowing the client the opportunity to hear 
themes and patterns that may provide insight into the distress of the 
present, affording the experience of the "Aha!" of making the 
unconscious conscious, the implicit explicit.

A
course of therapy is established no later than the third session with 
efficacy of treatment being revisited at intervals not to exceed 90 
days.  A typical completion of treatment is the amelioration or 
management of symptoms and the ability to be in the moment without 
perseverating on misgivings or failings of the past or anxieties and 
fears of the future, i.e. the ability to be in conscious loving 
relationship with oneself and others.  Interventions derived from 
insight based, cognitive, Jungian, and existential therapies will be 
employed.  Dream analysis or exercises in active imagination may also 
prove beneficial. 

Foremost,
you, the client, are the governor of the successful outcome of therapy.
 It works inasmuch as I, your therapist, am in active partnership with 
you and your desire to become who you are individually, uniquely seeking
to be.  Toward that end I have become facile at affording the client a 
completely confidential and guilt and shame free environment to process 
even the most delicate of situtations that impact their lives.  

In
the event that final sessions are foreseen, special effort is taken for
closure and/or referral to other providers as appropriate.  So many of 
our relationships do not have conscious begins or endings.  The planful 
ending of a therapeutic relationship can shed light upon and even 
facilitate the commencement of healing of less resolved relationships 
still impacting our lives.
