Robert brings over 30 years of experience in a variety of clinical, artistic, and spiritual settings along with a rich creative tradition as a composer, poet, and performing artist to his private practice.  All people are blessed with a creative birthright that can be severely compromised by unresolved pain and suffering.  Issues crying for resolution not only disrupt creative abilities, relationships, and manifestation, but can result in self destructive thoughts, feelings, and addictive behaviors. 

Every
person is unique and striving for their individual road toward 
fulfillment. Robert's affinity for the arts and years in offering family
support, addiction and trauma recovery, and crisis counseling make him 
particularly astute at assisting clients in establishing a renewed 
vision of their potential.
