# I am a psychotherapist trained in the [Depth][1] tradition of [Carl Jung][2], [James Hillman][3], and Joseph Campbell.

"As a psychotherapist I have assisted individuals, couples, and families to become healthier in their relationships, to address their addiction challenges, and to make meaning of traumatic personal suffering. "My work being [solution focused][4] while drawing from a [mythopoetic][5] depth orientation pays special attention to how the challenges in the moment illuminate opportunities and goals for the future. My overarching specialty is the enhancement of personal and spiritual fulfillment through creativity and choice."
